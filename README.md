# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to show Theare outcome based by launch date, and the outcomes based on goals. The way that this all shown was by using excel to create tables, graphs, and formulas to show how data can be used.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 In this project there was a table that was created in *Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date* sheet in the excel project, and from that pivot table there was a pivot chart created to help visualize what that pivot table is trying to explain. The way the pivot table was created is by adding a years column and using **Year()** formula and adding the Date Created Conversion column date into the **Year()** formula, and then copying the data given in the *Kickstarter* sheet. And inserting it in a a pivot table and creating a new sheet which is called *Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date*. Then opening the pivotchart fields and adding Category and Years into Filters, outcomes into the Legend, Date Created Conversion into Axis and removing Years2 and Quarters, and outcomes into Values. After creating a pivotchart line graph and changing the colors of the line graph.<img width="382" alt="Theatre_Outcome_vs_Launch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97326526/156063307-65c953d2-af5f-4359-9606-42abc236a316.png">
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second thing that was created from the Kickstarter project was the analysis of the outcomes based on goals, this would have the goals based on currency this was measured by creating a sheet called *Outcomes Based on Goals* and having a columns called Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, 
Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled. In the rows under would be an estimation of the amount that each of these kickstarter have a goal to create the plays the estimate would go by Less Than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 5000 to 9999, and going up by 4999 until it reaches 50,000 or More. Then to get retrieve the data from the *Kickstarter* sheet the use of the **COUNTIFS()** formula would be used this would be done for the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns. The COUNTIFS formula would look like this *=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,"<1000", Kickstarter!F:F,"successful", Kickstarter!R:R, "plays")*, *=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,">=1000", Kickstarter!F:F,"successful",Kickstarter!D:D,"<=4999", Kickstarter!R:R, "plays")*, *=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D,">=50000", Kickstarter!F:F,"successful", Kickstarter!R:R, "plays")*, for the Number Successful column, and changing the formula based on if succeful, failed, or canceled. The for Total Projects would use the **SUM()** formula which would sum up the number of project from Number of Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled for each estimated around so for the first estimated amount of Less than 1000 it would look like *=SUM(B2,C2,D2)*. And for the percentages use a simple division formula for Percentage Successful I used Number Succeessful and divide that by Total Projects and then change the number format to percentage. The formula for that looks like this *=(B2/E2)*. For the the graph take the data and created a line graph and filter out everything except all the percentages and change the colors accordingly and add a chart title.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The one main problem that I encountered was on the *Outcomes Based on Goals* I have never used **COUNTIFS** formula and was getting to know how to use the formula, everything was going well until I reached the Number Canceled column and saw that for each of the numbered canceled I had received 0. I wasnt sure if it was because I had done something wrong so I started to rewrite the formula in different ways to see if it was the something that I had done with the formula and I had kept getting error codes since I would sometimes forget to add " " for the criteria me losing confidence and thinking that maybe all of my formulas were incorrect. I would then go to the *Kickstarter* sheet to filter out and see how many canceled project there were, then to realize that there were actually 0 plays that had any canceled outcomes. 
## Results
For the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date conlcusion that can be drawn from the pivottable and pivotchart that can be made is , that most of the of the successful launches are made from April till August. Also it seems that most times it seems like that October to December seems to be the worst times for theatre especially in December with only 37 successful the lowest of the successful from the year. And october seems to have a 50% chance of success or failer with 65 successes and 50 failures that month. The conclusion about Outcomes based on Goals would seem like that plays with lower goals in the range of $0 to $5000 have a 70% success rate, and even a 66% success rate in ranges from $35000 to $44999. The limitation of the dataset in  Outcomes based on Goals is that it measures goals and not pledged for each play which may have a different analysis. Another graph that could be used to make it easier to see would be a cluster chart it would be easier to tell what happening from the data.
