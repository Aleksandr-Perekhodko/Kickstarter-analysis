## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to show Theare outcome based by launch date, and the outcomes based on goals. The way that this all shown was by using excel to create tables, graphs, and formulas to show how data can be used.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 In this project there was a table that was created in *Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date* sheet in the excel project, and from that pivot table there was a pivot chart created to help visualize what that pivot table is trying to explain. The way the pivot table was created is by adding a years column and using **Year()** formula and adding the Date Created Conversion column date into the **Year()** formula, and then copying the data given in the *Kickstarter* sheet. And inserting it in a a pivot table and creating a new sheet which is called *Theatre Outcomes By Launch Date*. Then opening the pivotchart fields and adding Category and Years into Filters, outcomes into the Legend, Date Created Conversion into Axis and removing Years2 and Quarters, and outcomes into Values. After creating a pivotchart line graph and changing the colors of the line graph.<img width="382" alt="Theatre_Outcome_vs_Launch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97326526/156063307-65c953d2-af5f-4359-9606-42abc236a316.png">
